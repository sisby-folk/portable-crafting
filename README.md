Open any crafting table by right-clicking it in the inventory, or using it in the hand without looking at a block.

When installed on the client, press a key (Default: `v`) to open the crafting table at any time you have one.

Or, install alongside Inventory Tabs to show a clickable tab.

## Afterword

All mods are built on the work of many others.

This mod specifically is inspired by a similar feature from Svenhjol's Charm - one of the few implementations of portable crafting grids that didn't introduce new items at the time.

We made this mod for [Tinkerer's Quilt](https://modrinth.com/modpack/tinkerers-quilt) - our modpack about ease of play and vanilla content.
